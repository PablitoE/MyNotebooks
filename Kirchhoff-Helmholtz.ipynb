    "# Propagation using Kirchhof-Helmholtz diffraction integral\n",
    "\n",
    "Propagation used to reconstruct holograms obtained by using a point source from which a spherical wave comes out with wavelength $\\lambda$. The implementation allows any regular sampling of the output window at a plane for constant $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From [Kreuzer patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6411406B1/en)\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffraction integral is\n",
    "$$K(\\overrightarrow{r}) = \\int_S d^2\\xi I(\\xi) e^{ik\\frac{\\overrightarrow{\\xi}\\cdot\\overrightarrow{r}}{\\xi}},$$\n",
    "where the wave number is $k=2\\pi/\\lambda$, $i=\\sqrt{-1}$, $S$ is the surface where the hologram $I(\\xi)$ (2D intensity image) is, $\\overrightarrow{\\xi} = (X,Y,L)$ are the coordinates in the hologram that is located $L$ away from the point source, and $\\overrightarrow{r} = (x,y,z)$ is the distance from the point source to the points in the output window.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following coordinates transform is applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X' = \\frac{XL}{R}, \\; Y' = \\frac{XL}{R}, \\; R = \\sqrt{L^2+X^2+Y^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That brings:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X = \\frac{X'L}{R'}, \\; Y = \\frac{X'L}{R'}, \\; R' = \\sqrt{L^2-X'^2-Y'^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The hologram is sampled (interpolated) into a regular grid on $(X',Y',L)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X'_p = X'_0 + p \\Delta X', \\; Y'_q = Y'_0 + q \\Delta Y', \\; p=0,\\dots, P-1, \\; q=0,\\dots, Q-1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And the output window is sampled using $x_n = x_0 + n\\delta_x, \\; y_m = y_0 + m\\delta_y, \\; n=0,\\dots, N-1, \\; m=0,\\dots, M-1.$ The diffraction integral becomes a 2D convolution (eq. 6 in patent) when we use the identity $np=[n^2+p^2—(n—p)^2]/2$ and $mq = [m^2+q^2—(m—q)^2]/2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$K_{nm} = \\Delta X' \\Delta Y' e^{\\frac{ik}{L}(x_nX'_0 + y_mY'_0)} e^{\\frac{ik}{2L} (n^2\\delta_x\\Delta X' + m^2\\delta_y\\Delta Y')} \\mbox{IFFT}\\{\\tilde{K}'_{uv} \\tilde{R}_u \\tilde{R}_v\\},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{K}'_{uv} = \\mbox{FFT}\\{K'_{pq}\\} = \\mbox{FFT}\\left\\{I'_{pq} e^{\\frac{ik}{L}(px_0\\Delta X' + qy_0 \\Delta Y' + \\frac{p^2 \\delta_x\\Delta X'}{2} + \\frac{q^2 \\delta_y\\Delta Y'}{2})}\\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I'_{pq} = I(X(X'_p,Y'_q),Y(X'_p,Y'_q)) \\left(\\frac{L}{R'}\\right)^4 e^{ikz\\frac{R'}{L}}$$\n",

    "$$\\tilde{R}_u = \\mbox{FFT}\\left\\{R_s\\right\\} = \\mbox{FFT}\\left\\{ e^{-\\frac{ik}{2L}s^2\\delta_x\\Delta X'} \\right\\}, \\; \\tilde{R}_v = \\mbox{FFT}\\left\\{ R_t \\right\\} = \\mbox{FFT}\\left\\{ e^{-\\frac{ik}{2L}t^2\\delta_y\\Delta Y'} \\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sampling issues\n",
    "\n",
    "A proper sampling of $K'_{pq}$ is obtained if the phase factor in the exp term $\\Phi_K = kz\\frac{R'}{L} + \\frac{k}{L}(px_0\\Delta X' + qy_0 \\Delta Y' + \\frac{p^2 \\delta_x\\Delta X'}{2} + \\frac{q^2 \\delta_y\\Delta Y'}{2})$, has $\\left|\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_K}{\\partial p}\\right| \\leq \\pi$, or, for fixed $\\Delta X'$ and $P$ (proper sampling of the hologram), and solving for $q=0$ as it produces the highest gradients in $p$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta_x \\leq \\frac{1}{P}\\left(\\frac{L \\lambda}{2 \\Delta X'} - x_0 + \\frac{z}{R'}X'_{P-1}\\right)\\mbox{, similar for }\\delta_y.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is usually met.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other terms $R_s$ and $R_t$ need to be properly sampled too, and they usually aren't. As these terms are convolved with $K'_{pq}$, they are evaluated as e.g. $R_{n-p}$, then $s = -P+1, \\dots, N-1$ and $t = -Q+1, \\dots, M-1$. So, $R_s$ has to be properly sampled up to $s= \\hat{S} = max(P-1, N-1)$ and $R_t$ up to $t = \\hat{T} = \\max(Q-1,M-1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the contributions from a relatively small particle in $I$ take part mainly around them, it is probably a good option to truncate $R_s$ and $R_t$ where they begin to be incorrectly sampled, giving $\\hat{S}' \\leq \\hat{S}$ and $\\hat{T}' \\leq \\hat{T}$. Otherwise, $\\delta_x$ and $\\delta_y$ could be changed to have e.g. $\\left|\\frac{\\partial \\Phi_R}{\\partial s}\\right| \\leq \\pi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\delta_x \\leq \\frac{\\lambda L}{2\\hat{S}\\Delta X'}, \\; \\delta_y \\leq \\frac{\\lambda L}{2\\hat{T}\\Delta Y'}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But if the same output window is expected, then $N$ and $M$ should change to $N' = N\\frac{\\delta_x^{ini}}{\\delta_x^{new}}$ and $M' = M\\frac{\\delta_y^{ini}}{\\delta_y^{new}}$, which, for $N' > P, (\\hat{S} = N')$ reaches the condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2 N \\Delta X' \\delta_x^{ini} \\leq \\lambda L.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Border effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz diffraction integral (KHDI) is used having a contrast hologram as input instead of the direct hologram. The contrast hologram is calculated from a hologram $I^H$ and a background image $I^B$ as $I = \\frac{I^H - I^B}{I^B}$. The backgroun image is the intensity that the camera senses without particles in the sampled volume. The hologram has a mean value in most pixels and diffraction patterns coming from a particle show as circular fringes. This way, $I$ is usually 0 in the borders, so it's okay to use zero padding when calculating the convolution for the KHDI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we'll use $I = I^H/I^B$ so that $I\\equiv 1$ close to the borders. In this case, is preferable to pad with $(\\hat{S}', \\hat{T}')$ 1s before performing the convolution."
