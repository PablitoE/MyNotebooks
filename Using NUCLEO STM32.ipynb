    "# Notes on Nucleo STM32\n",
    "\n",
    "Using STM32CubeIDE\n",
    "\n",
    "Help for the board is in `C:\\Users\\j05625pe\\STM32Cube\\Repository\\STM32Cube_FW_F0_V1.11.2\\Drivers\\STM32F0xx_HAL_Driver`\n",
    "\n",
    "Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI-CQBKWbDY&list=PLnMKNibPkDnGtuIl5v0CvC81Am7SKpj02&index=37\n",
    "\n",
    "## MX perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select board. My Nucleo is STM32F091RC\n",
    "2. Choose pins functionality and configure\n",
    "    a. If there is overlap, CTRL click to get alternatives.\n",
    "3. Choose clocks.\n",
    "4. Generate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C/C++ perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify main function. Use HAL functions for using core system and peripherals.\n",
    "2. Build.\n",
    "3. Debug or run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interrupts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In MX use GPIO pins as EXTI.\n",
    "2. Enable in NVIC and set priorities (HAL_Delay works with SYSCLK which needs higher priority (lower value) than EXTI to work in a Callback).\n",
    "3. Look for EXTI handler in stm32f0xx_it.c. That function uses a function in stm32f0xx_hal_gpio.c that is associated to a Callback function with \\__weak definition.\n",
    "4. Copy that function (without \\__weak) to the USER CODE 0 section in main.c, and define in the USER CODE 4 section.\n",
    "5. Use a switch GPIO_Pin case when different sources of EXTI are possible, to know which one produced the interrupt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## UART\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure using MX\n",
    "2. HAL_UART_Transmit (Receive) (Blocking functions)\n",
    "3. Check COM for STLink in Device Manager (COM4)\n",
    "4. RealTerm to watch port.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Interrupt (_IT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Callbacks for every sent/received byte?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recover Callback functions from driver src and take to main to define.\n",
    "2. Before main while, HAL_UART_Receive_IT or Transmit only once.\n",
    "3. Identify which USART is working in the Callback with a switch case.\n",
    "4. The HAL_UART_Receive_IT has to be called in the callback to keep waiting the following RX.\n",
    "\n",
    "### With DMA stream\n",
    "\n",
    "Callbacks only when the transfer is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do not enable NVIC for the UART.\n",
    "2. Add the rx and tx DMA and generate.\n",
    "3. Use USART callbacks for doing something when the DMAs are full.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure Timer (Prescaler -1, period -1...)\n",
    "2. Initialized timers are not running timers. Use HAL_TIM_Base_Start_IT()\n",
    "3. Look for desired Callback in hal_tim.c -> HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback()\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1, define the source as internal clock or external trigger to use timer as counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PWM\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configure Pin as TIM-CH.\n",
    "2. Configure the PWM duty cycle as a count number below the period auto-reset.\n",
    "3. Use HAL_TIM_PWM_Start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ADC\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose one ADC input pin.\n",
    "2. Configure. Select a sampling time measured in clock cycles.\n",
    "3. Enable interrupt. NVIC\n",
    "4. Use HAL_ADC_Start_IT in main (before while).\n",
    "5. Get the Callback from drivers. HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback() and define outside main function.\n",
    "6. Each conversion (interrupt) requires a HAL_ADC_GetValue(), result goes to uint16_t as it has 12 bits.\n",
    "7. Start again with HAL_ADC_Start_IT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STMStudio\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open STMStudio\n",
    "2. File-Import Variables : Debug/\\*.elf -> Select and Import\n",
    "3. Right Click -> send to var viewer\n",
    "4. Set upper value\n",
    "5. Play (Debugger off)\n",
    "\n",
    "### DMA\n",
    "\n",
    "For using the DMA \"Continuous conversion mode\" and \"DMA continuous requests\" have to be enabled. Then, is similar to using DMA with USART. The function expects a uint32_t* buffer but it uses the type of data from the configuration (half word). It does not require the callback because the values are stored in the buffer."

Reverse the polarity and the actuator retracts. This can be accomplished manually with a DPDT switch or relay, or using an H-Bridge circuit. Position of the actuator stroke can be monitored by providing any stable low and high reference voltage on pins 1 & 5, then reading the position signal on pin 2. The voltage on pin 2 will vary linearly between the two reference voltages in proportion to the position of the actuator stroke. \n",

    "The L12 –P actuator can be used as a linear servo by connecting the actuator to an external controller such as the LAC board offered by Firgelli. This control board reads the position signal from the L12, compares it with your input control signal then commands the actuator to move via an onboard H-bridge circuit. The LAC allows any one of  the following control inputs: Analog 0-5V or 4-20mA, or Digital 0-5V PWM, 1-2ms Standard RC, or USB. The RC input effectively transforms your L12 into a linear servo, which is a direct replacement for any common hobby servo used in RC toys and robotics. Refer to the LAC datasheet for more details. \n",
