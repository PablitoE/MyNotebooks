    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which of the two processes you think it would have more impact in lowering uncertainties of simulation models?\n",
    "2. Is there another aspect that should be used to decide where to put more time?\n",
    "3. Rime splintering, large supercooled water droplets impacted by ice particles, freezes and shatters\n",
    "    1. LARGE : what dimensions?\n",
    "    2. SUPERCOOLED : what range of temperatures?\n",
    "4. Rime splintering, ways of recreating:\n",
    "    1. How to deliver droplets? Nanodispenser, syringe, printer inkjet\n",
    "    2. Cold stage with printed structure and cool sheath air, how are they thought of as riming? Is this done in the cold room?\n",
    "    3. Chamber with generated ice particles in lower part. Paul talked about trying to generate it using the mist generator. Dates? It would be great to get the best configuration (drop trajectory and velocity, depth of cloud). That way we could put the sampled volume of the DHM where is more likely to get the process.\n",
    "    4. Does it make sense having the supercooled droplet levitating and immersed on ice particles flow or shot at with ice particles? How can we shoot ice particles?\n",
    "5. Freezing/shattering droplets. Large millimeter size droplets (around -25째C) or smaller droplets (85 $\\mu$m) with inclusions at -10째C to -15째C.\n",
    "    1. In case of using a levitator, we should add an air flow. How can we create a dry air flow?\n",
    "    2. Wind tunnel seems optimum. What can we use? Stability? Dimensions of set-up interfering with flow?\n",
    "    3. Experiments to find conditions to shatter? Freezing temperature, composition.\n",
    "    4. Does it make sense looking at the mist as it freezes and tracking many particles until one shatters?   \n",
    "6. What do you think about using Google Docs to share thoughts about the project?"
