    "  \n",
    "Normally, the images will be already contrast images creaated by using Python scripts as `contrast_video.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting the config file: rules and threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "A single image should be observed with holoViewer to check if the threshold value is okay. Also check filling gaps and expansion, and spatial filters cutoffs. A set of config files for multiple sequences can be generated using `set_configs_seqs.m`. Once that is set in the config file, run the reconstruction over a single sequence, or part of it. Use `carft.m` to find rules and the tree that would classify particles as particles and artifacts as artifacts. It is good practice to start with a rule on `numzs` or `tphunderthr`, classify some of each class, predict and then see the tree to start challenging the decisions of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reconstruction of a sequence of holograms using Holosuite in local PC\n",
    "\n",
    "The images in a sequence could be equalised (self or using background images) and converted to PNG format, use `PrepSeqHoloSuite`. It is better to perform the equalisation by extracting a background hologram from the images. To easily convert images to PNG use `mogrify -format png -path ./new_folder  *.tiff`. A better option is to use scripts such as `contrast_video.py` or `contrast_video_from_images.py`. The background is obtained by removing outliers from the calculation of the median intensity. If the contrast holograms are found by doing $\\frac{I-I_B}{I_B}$, the threshold should be set as high and low, but for $\\frac{I}{I_B}$, using the lower threshold is enough. The contrast holograms are saved along a `config.txt` that says the scaling factors. Holosuite can read the images with these factors so that the dynamic range is kept reasonably good.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are then reconstructed using `useHolosuiteSequence.m`, where the config file must be set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run in JASMIN\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single job\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `slurm_HRSeq.sh`. Save the output in the corresponding folders in JASMIN and `C:\\Work\\Scripting\\CompileHolosuite` by using rsync. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single or multiple sequences of holograms with SLURM array\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `slurm_array_HRSeqs.sh`. Set the amount of jobs (as high as the amount of holograms in all the sequences). All the sequences should be in their own directory (with a config file) within a single main directory. Adapt `reconSomeSequences.py` with this information (MAIN_PATH). Config files should have the name given in the Python script in different folders, inside the directories of list MAIN_PATHS, or just a single config file in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check output for errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Jupyter Notebook in JASMIN `Check_output_holosuite.ipyn`. First script tells which jobs got error. They can be processed in JASMIN again by changing the dedicated (usually commented) part in `reconSomeSequences.py`. Modify the list of bad errors and the amount of jobs for the first run. Otherwise, they can be run again in the PC using `Scripting\\useHolosuiteSequence.m`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Copy the results back to PC\n",
    "\n",
    "Use bash script from MobaXterm in `PC-W:get_results_scp.sh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prepare config file to get the positions of the particles\n",
    "\n",
    "Some properties are set automatically when the config files were created, as:\n",

    "    NameCampaign = GlassBeads2um\n",
    "    IncludeTotal = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run use_wolke\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the rules and the tree are set, `use_wolke.m` is used for applying the tree to multiple hist files using a specific config file (with required fields in Dynamic Properties). This script gets a classification of the particles as set in the tree, adapts the coordinates to the spherical illumination setup and shows histograms and images of the detected particles."
